# SPWeather App

This was built and optimized for the iPhone X, so simulating it on the iPhone X will yield the best results. 

## Features

SPWeather loads the coming week's weather data from api.darksky.net and displays it to the user. The user's current location is the default location, although it is possible to change the location by clicking on the edit button.

[LocationPicker](https://github.com/JeromeTan1997/LocationPicker) is a swift library that allows the user to select a location
